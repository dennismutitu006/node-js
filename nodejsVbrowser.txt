Browser vs Nodejs
In the browser, most of the time what you are doing is interacting with the
DOM, or other Web Platform APIs like Cookies. Those do not exist in Node.js.
 You don't have the document, window and all the other objects that are provided by the browser.
And in the browser, we don't have all the nice APIs that Node.js provides through its modules, 
like the filesystem access functionality.

In nodejs u can control the environmnent-unless u r building an opensource app that anyone can
deploy from anywhere, you know which version of nodejs will run he app on. Compared to the browser
u dont get to choose what broswer ur vistors choose to use.

nodejs perfoms both commonjS and ES module syst while in the broswer we are starting to see the 
ES modules stardard being implemented meaning you can use both require() and import in Nodejs
but in browser u are restricted to import
