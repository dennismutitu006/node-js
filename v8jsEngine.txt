V8 is the name of the js engine that powers Google chrome.
its the thing that takes our js and executes it while browing with chrome.

This engine is independ of the brwoser it's hosted.which enabled the rise of
 nodejs 

js is generally considered as an interpreted language, but modern js engines no longer 
just interprate, they compile it.
js is internally compiled by v8 with just-in-time (JIT) compilation to speed up the execution.
